- Note: for an explanation of equations see handwritten notes

- p. 1022: “site index” can be understood as a measure of potential height growth

- p. 1022: apart from the site index, several yield tables have introduced a second dimension for indexing sites;
this second dimension is called “production class” by Bradley et al. (1966), “yield level“ by Assmann & Franz (1963) and by Bergel (1985), “increment level” by Lembcke et al. (1975);
“this second dimension of site quality is an expression of that part of the variation of potential density of sites that is independent of the site index”

- p. 1023: based on the “Competition Density Rule” found by Kira et al. (1953), Tadaki (1963), Ando (1968) and Ando et al. (1968) found the following interdependence:
v = 1 / (AN + B) eq. (1)
v: mean volume
A = a_0 h^(a_1)
h: stand height
N: stem number per ha
B = b_0 h^(b_1)

- p. 1023: according to Goulding (1972), equation (1) fitted better for mean diameter than for volume of Douglas fir (eq. (2)):
d = 1 / (AN + B) eq. (2)
d: mean diameter
A = a_0 h^(a_1) eq. (3)
h: stand height
N: stem number per ha
B = b_0 h^(b_1) eq. (4);
substituting eq. (3) and (4) into eq. (2), one obtains:
d = 1 / (a_0 h^(a_1) N + b_0 h^(b_1)) eq. (5) [cp. Wördehoff et al. (2014), (Gl. 1)]

- p. 1023: equation (2) can be used to calculate basal area per hectare:
G = Pi N (d^2) / 4 = Pi N / 4 / (AN + B)^2 [cp. Assmann (1961), p. 209]
G: basal area per hectare

- p. 1023: the number of stems at maximum basal area per hectare can be obtained by setting the first derivate dG / dN of the abovementioned equation to zero:
dG / dN = Pi (AN - B) / 4 (AN + B)^3 = 0
=> N_Gmax = B / A
N_Gmax: number of stems at maximum basal area per hectare

- p. 1023: combining the abovementioned equation and eq. (2) one can obtain the mean diameter at maximum basal area:
d_Gmax = 1 / (2 B)
d_Gmax: mean diameter at maximum basal area

- p. 1023: [substituting N_Gmax and d_Gmax into the equation for G, one obtains:
G_max = Pi N_Gmax d_Gmax / 4 = Pi / (16 a_0 b_0 h^(a_1 + b_1)) (cp. Wördehoff et al. (2014), (Gl. 3))]

- p. 1024: substituting A and B with the help of eq. (3) and (4) one obtains the asymptotic values of N_Gmax and d_Gmax as a function of a constant dominant height:
N_Gmax = b_0 / a_0 h^(b_1 - a_1) eq. (6)
d_Gmax = h^(-b_1) / 2 b_0 eq. (7)
N_Gmax: number of stems at maximum basal area
d_Gmax: mean diameter at maximum basal area
h: dominant height

- p. 1024: according to eq. (6) and as long as a_1 > b_1, in an unmanaged stand N_Gmax has to be reduced by self-thinning with increasing h in order to maintain Gmax


- p. 1024: the “maximum basal area, established only by natural mortality, was called “natural basal area” by Assmann (1955) and found to be a good indicator to find the “yield level,” i.e., the second index besides the site index in his yield tables for Norway spruce (Assman and Franz (1963)”

- p. 1024: solving eq. (7) for h [i.e., “expressing height as a function of mean diameter at maximum density”], one obtains:
h = (2 b_0 d_Gmax)^(-1 / b_1);
substituting this equation into eq. (6), one obtains:
N_Gmax = b_0 / a_0 (2 b_0 d_Gmax)^(a_1 / b_1 -1) eq. (9) [cp. Wördehoff et al. (2014), (Gl. 2)]

- p. 1025: in order to apply eq. (14) to a stand one would first need to estimate the function coefficients a_0, a_1, b_0, and b_1 of eq. (5) or of eq. (13) [not sure why Sterba does not mention coefficient b_1 in his listing of coefficients of eq. (13), since it is contained in coefficient E and as such part of the equation]

- p. 1025: [Sterba seems to consider age and dominant height as equivalent]

- p. 1028: [procedure to determine whether it is justified to use one estimate of E for all experiments instead of using an individual estimate of E for each experiment]},

Using basal areas reported in yield tables as a reference for grading the strength of thinning is problematic if the yield table does not fit the stand in question or if it is erroneous. In the case of thinning trials, strength of thinning should be graded based on basal area of the weakly thinned stands belonging to the respective trial instead of on yield table values.

- p. 102: definitions of stand density index (SDI):
A. actual stem number divided by maximum stem number at the same mean diameter
B. stem number which the current stand would have if its mean diameter was 10 inches or 25 cm

- p. 102, Zusammenstellung 1: [mathematical explanation of the SDI]

- p. 102 f.: compared to Bestockungsgrad, the SDI has the advantage of being independent of both tree species, tree age and Bonität

- p. 103: correct interpretation of the SDI requires knowledge of the maximum SDI, which in turn depends on tree species and stand type

- p. 105, eq. (4): coefficients A' and B' are constant for all stands with the same top height [Oberhöhe]

- p. 104-106: The steps covered in Zusammenstellung 2 allow calculation of the coefficients of Reineke’s SDI using estimates of the coefficients of the Competition-Density-Rule. [I’m not sure whether this is true, cp. Notes, p. 5 f. Also, I would be hesitant to speak of “calculation” if it is based on a mere estimate.] This in turn allows one to validate Reineke’s exponent of “-1.605”, while also allowing the comparison of tree species and sites in terms of maximum SDI, i.e., Ertragsniveau.

- p. 106 f.: The coefficients of eq. (15) (a_0, a_1, b_0, and b_1) can be estimated through nonlinear regression by applying eq. (15) to parcels of the same stand type, but with different age and stand density. [What does “stand type” mean in this context?]
Using eq. (13) and (14), one is then able to calculate coefficients A and B of eq. (12) [which is based on eq. (1)].

- p. 109 f. and fig. 5: the specifications given by Assman & Franz (1965) follow Reineke’s assumption of a linear relationship between ln(N/ha) and ln(dg) and also follow a parallel translation if quality class [Bonität] increases

- p. 110 f.: the results of Marschall (1975) did not show significant deviations from Reineke’s assumption of B = -1.605.},

- p. 22: eq. (9.4) is the GCV [generalized cross validation] score for the model and its efficient minimization is the key to the approach used in mgcv

- p. 22: the term “i.i.d.” used in the model description stands for “independent and identically distributed”

- p. 22: [high values (e.g., 20) of argument “k” in the call “gam(Y ~ s(X, k = …))” mean that the relationship between the dependent variable “Y” and the independent variable “X” are expected to be fairly complicated]

- p. 23: When deciding whether or not to drop a certain term, the following 3 questions need to be answered:
1. “Is the estimated degrees of freedom for the term close to 1?”
2. “Does the plotted confidence band for the term include zero everywhere?”
3. “Does the GCV score drop when the term is dropped?”
If all questions can be answered with “yes” then the term should be dropped.
If the e.d.f. [estimated degrees of freedom] is close to 1 but the answer to 2. is “no” then the term may as well be replaced with a parametric linear term.},

- p. 627: the stand density index “is premised on the characteristic distribution of tree sizes in even-aged stands” [i.e., it should not be applicable to uneven-aged stands]

- p. 627: it is possible to a certain extent to describe the relative diameter distribution [i.e., ratio of trees of a stand sharing the same diameter plotted over diameter] of a given stand by mean diameter alone

- p. 628: stands of differing density can be compared with each other if one uses a certain stand (which is considered to have a density of 100 \%) as a shared reference

- p. 628: for stands with the same density, however, the absolute number of trees differs with differing mean diameter

- p. 628: he relationship of trees per area over mean diameter assumes a line when plotted on a double logarithmic scale (i.e., log(N/A) over log(dg)). The equation describing this line is log(N) = -1.605 log D + k

- p. 628: the curve with k = 4.605 will be referred to as the “reference curve” (this curve passes through the point with D = 10 inches and N = 1000 trees/acre)

- p. 629, fig. 1: the stand density (see right axis) is the number of trees per acre (left axis) at an average diameter of 10 inches (bottom axis)

- p. 631 f.: The plots reported use the maximum as the reference curve. While ordinarily it would be better to use the average as the reference curve, it is better to use the maximum when working with data from yield studies. This is, because in yield studies the available data usually suffers from a bias: older, more mature stands are usually the poorly stocked ones, since the more densely stocked stands have already been cut at this respective age. Thus, the large-diameter end of the “number of trees–average diameter” curve would be lowered. This lowering can be avoided by fitting to the maximum. However, when the conditions of random sampling are met, it is better to fit to average rather than maximum.

- p. 634: statistical analysis showed no significant effect of age or site quality on trees per unit area for a given average diameter

- p. 636: The stand density index is the number of trees the stand would have, if its average diameter was 10 inches. In order to determine this number, one needs to assume that the stand’s development follows the relationship laid out by the respective reference curve.},

- p. 38, Jane Superbrain 2.2: “In statistical terms the degrees of freedom relate to the number of observations that are free to vary” when trying to calculate the standard deviation of the population to which the observations belong to.
Example: 4 observations: x_1 = 8, x_2 = 9, x_3 = 11, x_4 = 12, mean(x_i) = 10. We thus assume the population mean to be 10 and keep this value constant. If we were to take another set of 4 observations from the population, only 3 of these observations would be free to vary in order to not violate our assumption of the population mean to be 10 (e.g., if in our 2. sample x_1 = 7, x_2 = 15, and x_3 = 8 then x_4 would need to be 10 in order to keep the assumption of mean(x) = 10). “This fact explains why when we use a sample to estimate the standard deviation of a population, we have to divide the sums of squares by N-1 rather than N alone.”

- p. 3: definition of a “smooth” [cp. Notes, p. 1]

- p. 11:“Most smoothers attempt to mimic category averaging through local averaging”, where the “averaging is done in neighbourhoods around the target value.”
“Smoothers differ mainly in their method of averaging.”
“The size of the neighbourhood is typically expressed in terms of an adjustable smoothing parameter.”
”There is a fundamental tradeoff between bias and variance, governed by the smoothing parameter.” (large neighbourhood = low variance but potentially high bias; small neighbourhood = high variance but potentially low bias)

- p. 22: Regression splines represent the model fit as a piecewise polynomial.

- p. 82: [A “design vector” contains all measurements of the predictor (or independent) variables for a given object (cp. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_matrix).]

- p. 83: [Listing of the benefits of linear regression models, which, however, are only applicable if the underlying assumption of a linear relationship between response (or dependent) variable and the predictors assumption.]

- p. 83: Explanation of the “curse of dimensionality”: the term stands for the fact that with increasing number of dimensions [i.e., the number of predictors], the side length of a cube comprising a local average of all predictors increases as well [e.g., for p = 3 dimensions and a cube comprising 0.3 \% of the total volume of 100 the side length would be (0.3 \% * 100) ^ 1/3 = 0.669, for p = 10 it would be (0.3 \% * 100) ^ 1/10 = 0.887, which can hardly be called “local” anymore].

- p. 83 f.: Due to the “curse of dimensionality”, one, in order to preserve the meaning of a “local” average, is forced to use kernels with a smaller bandwidth [for an explanation of the term “bandwidth” in the context of kernel smoothers cp. Notes, p. 1] as dimensions increase, which in turn requires increasingly more data in order to obtain variance stable estimates.
Despite this, surface smoothers are still useful, especially for 2 dimensions (where the obtained estimate can be illustrated as a plane in 3D space).

- p. 88: The ease of interpreting an additive model comes at the price of the model almost always being an approximation to the true regression surface.
The purpose of an additive model is not to be correct but rather to aid in uncovering the important predictors and their influence on the response.

- fig. 4.6: illustration of the possible different components of an additive model

- p. 137: elements of a genearlized linear model:
 - random component (the response Y is assumed to have exponential family density)
 - systematic component (the expectation of Y is assumed to be related to the set of covariates by the so called linear predictor)
 - link function (linking random component and systematic component (e.g., the logit))

- p. 137: [The term “exponential family” refers to a set of probability distributions of a certain form (cp. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_family).]

- p. 140: A generalized additive model differs from a generalized linear model in that the linear predictor is replaced by an additive predictor.
Thus, the elements of a generalized additive model are:
 - random component (the response Y is assumed to have exponential family density)
 - systematic component (the expectation of Y is assumed to be related to the set of covariates by the so called additive predictor)
 - link function (linking random component and systematic component (e.g., the logit))

- p. 161: “Typically the width of the standard-error bands, approximate deviance tests and residual plots give support to the important features of the fit, and give the analyst warnings about those features that are likely to be spurious.”},

- p. 122: [covariate = predictor]

- p. 122: [i.i.d. = independent and identically distributed]

- p. 122: In order to estimate the smooth function f from eq. (3.2) using the methods of linear modelling, f must be reprensented in such a way that eq. (3.2) becomes a linear model. This can be done by choosing a basis (defining a space of functions of which f (or its approximation) is an element), which amounts to choosing some basis functions, which will be treated as completely known.

- p. 122: If smooth function f is believed to be a 4th order polynomial, it means that the space of polynomials of order 4 and below is believed to contain f.
[Thus, the following basis functions are valid: b_1(x) = 1, b_2(x) = x, b_3(x) = x^2, b_4(x) = x^3, b_5(x) = x^4.]

- p. 124: definition of “cubic spline”:
“A cubic spline is a curve made up of sections of cubic polynomial[s] joined together so that they are continuous in value, as well as first and second derivatives […]. The points at which the sections join are known as the knots of the spline. […] for the regression splines of interest here, the locations of the knots must be chosen.”

- p. 133 f.: Important remarks on the additive model given by eq. (3.7):
1. The model “f_1(x) + f_2(z)” is a quite restrictive special case of the general smooth function of 2 variables “f(x, z)”.
2. The fact that the model contains more than one function introduces an identifiability problem insofar, as a constant could be added to f_1 and simultaneously subtracted from f_2 without changing model predicitions. Thus, identifiability constraints must be imposed before fitting.},

Plants are subject to a phenomenon called “self-thinning”, according to which the average biomass of an individual plant is negatively related to the number of plants per unit area. In a log-log plot the envelope has a slope of -1.5, and the underlying relation is therefore called “-3/2 power law”.

- p. 29 f.: {introduction}
In forest stands the afforementioned slope of the envelope is usually steeper than -1.5 and approximately -1.65 – -1.8.},

- p. 206: While the log-log plot envelope’s slope of -1.605 is generally applicable, its intercept depends on quality class of the stand in question (higher quality class leads to a higher intercept).

- p. 208: Reineke’s “stand density rule” turns out to be a special case of Yoda’s “-3/2 power rule”.

- p. 208: Species-specific deviances from Reineke’s constant of -1.605 can be explained by the respective species’s biomass-diameter-relation, given that the -3/2 power rule is valid.

[How to move between Yoda’s rule and Reineke’s rule.] Both Reineke’s stand density rule and Yoda’s -3/2 power rule are based on the allometric relationships between volume, projection surface and surface of stereometric [i.e., 3-dimensional] objects. In particular, Yoda’s -3/2 power rule is based on the allometric relationships between volume and projection surface of a sphere and between volume and mass [cp. eq. (9) and eq. (10)].},

[How to convert the SDI reference diameter from 10 inch (imperial unit) to metric units:]
When trying to determine a stand’s SDI, one can use 25 cm as the reference mean diameter instead of 10 inch as proposed by Reineke (1933). [This allows to compare SDI values obtained using either the metric or the imperial unit reference diameter.]

- p. 157:
When comparing the SDI of different stands, the following relationships hold:
- for a given mean diameter the SDI increases with increasing stem number
- for a given stem number the SDI increases with increasing mean diameter

- p. 157:
The SDI may NOT be directly compared to the degree of stocking reported in yield tables, since yield table values do not refer to stands with maximum stocking density [Whereas the SDI, by definition, applies only to unthinned stands, i.e., to stands with maximum stocking density.].

- p. 157:
Main advantages of the SDI [compared to yield table degrees of stocking]:
- it does not require estimation of stand age (which is highly error prone)
- it does not require estimation of quality class
- it is independent of tree species (as long as the assumption holds that the slope of the ln(N)-ln(dg)-curve for the stand in question is approx. -1.605)},

- Abstract: Results indicate that for some tree species the slope of the log(N)-log(dg)-curve differs significantly (Fagus sylvatica) or close-to-significantly (Picea abies, Quercus petraea) from the value of -1.605 postulated by Reineke whereas for Pinus sylvestris it does not differ significantly.

- p. 306:
[I was not able to retrace the authors’s result of “∆ N / N ÷ ∆ d / d = -1.605”. Note: Zeide (1985) may be of interest in this regard, since he introduced this quotient (cp. p. 316).]

- p. 315:
The study revealed that in 4 out of 6 possible two-species comparisons the slope of the log(N)-log(dg)-curve differed significantly from species to species.
The species can be sorted based on estimated steepness of slope:
1. Fagus sylvatic: -1.789
2. Picea abies: -1.664
3. Pinus sylvestris: -1.593
4. Quercus petraea: -1.424

- p. 317:
“The disadvantage of the SDI is that it generally assumes the coefficient b = -1.605 to be valid. Wherever this allometric coefficient fails to apply there will be severe errors in stand density estimates.”

- p. 317 fig. 6:
The figure examplifies the over- or underestimation of the actual SDI its calculation is based on an incorrect allometric coefficient.},

Even if allometric relationships appear to be uniform and to be restricted to a certain corridor of possible self thinning-curves on the stand level, it may very well differ between individuals within a stand due to differences in size, age, or competition induced stress.
