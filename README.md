This repository includes both the R code as well as the LaTeX documents pertaining to my Masterâ€™s Thesis.
The thesis involves prediction of maximum basal area of pure even-aged beech and spruce stands in northwestern Germany using GAMs, SCAMs and GAMLSSs via the R packages gam, scam, and gamlss, respectively. The R code used to produce all figures of the final thesis is contained in file R/MasArThesisRCode.org, which requires Emacs Org Mode to be viewed and executed properly. Please note that the data used for model training are NOT contained in the repository.
