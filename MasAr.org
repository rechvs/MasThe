** R Code Style Guidelines
*** Where to find Google’s R Style Guide?
    + [[file:~/Privat/Anleitungen_etc/Software/R/Google_s_R_Style_Guide.xml][Google’s R Style Guide]]
*** Which objects are constants?
    + An object is considered a constant if its value is (meant to be) hardcoded or if its value is the indirect result of functions acting only on hardcoded values.
*** How to delimit blocks?
    + A “block” is a (more or less) self-contained piece of code separated from the surrounding code like this (Note the missing dot in the block header and the empty line at the end.)
     ################
     ## BLOCK NAME ##
     ################
     PIECE OF CODE
     ...

*** How to delimit subblocks?
    + A “subblock” is a piece of code within a block separated from the surrounding code like this:
      ###################
      ## SUBBLOCK NAME ##
      PIECE OF CODE
      ...
      ## SUBBLOCK NAME ##
      ###################
*** How to comment multi-line function calls?
    + If a function call spans several lines, comments regarding the function call in general (and not just a specific argument) should go on the line of the opening paranthesis.

     “- p. PAGE1 [tab. TABLE1 [tab. TABLE1.1]|fig. FIGURE1 [fig. FIGURE1.1]][, p. PAGE2 [tab. TABLE2 [tab. TABLE2.1]|fig. FIGURE2 [fig. FIGURE2.1]]]”

*** Tags
**** How to tag a comment (i.e., an individual “entry” within the “Abstract” portion of an entry)
     “- p. XY: {TAG1; TAG2}
      COMMENT CONTENT”
**** How to tag a whole entry
     “- whole TYPE_OF_MEDIUM: {TAG1; TAG2}”
     + Subsequent comments should only be tagged if their tag set differs from that of the whole entry. If such a comment is tagged, however, its tag set overwrites that of the whole article. Thus, if the tag set of a comment should only contain an additional tag compared to the tag set of the whole entry, the tag set must contain both the tag set of the whole entry plus the additional tag.
