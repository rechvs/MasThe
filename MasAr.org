* NOTES
** R Code Style Guidelines
   + [[file:~/Privat/Anleitungen_etc/Software/R/Google_s_R_Style_Guide.xml][Google’s R Style Guide]]
   + constants: an object is considered a constant if its value is (meant to be) hardcoded or if its value is the indirect result of functions acting only on hardcoded values
   + beginning of “blocks” are marked by a block header of the following form (note the absence of a dot at the end):

*** [2017-05-26 Fr]
    + got function [[file:R/Scripts/Modelling.R::94][nls2::nls2]] to converge but, judging by [[file:R/Scripts/Plotting.R::19][this]], results still seem unsatisfactory
    + apparently, “(Gl. 3)” from Wördehoff et al. (2014) assumes “[Gmax] = m^2 m^-2”;
      when trying to [[file:R/Scripts/Modelling.R::kFormulas%5B%5B"Sterba_Gmax"%5D%5D][fit this equation]], we therefore need to didivde the value of “bart.clean$gha” by 10000 in order to obtain the required unit
*** [2017-06-01 Do]
    + added block “Plot relations and respective model predictions” to and refined [[file:R/Scripts/Plotting.R::1][Plotting.R]]
