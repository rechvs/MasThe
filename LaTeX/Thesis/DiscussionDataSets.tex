\subsection{Data sets}

Although sample plots in both species covered a large range of geographical locations and altitudes (cp. \Cref{fig:LocationsSamplePlots,fig:SpeciesAltitudeOfSamplePlots}), neither of these properties could be harnessed as a predictor variable in either species, probably due to the small data set sizes.

Both data sets showed a strong correlation between stand age and \ProductivityIndexText{} (cp. \Cref{fig:StandAgeProductivityIndexYieldClassClassification}). Even if this correlation is not the result of a causal relationship, it still reduces generalizability of model predictions:  since old highly productive stands as well as young lowly productive stands were absent in the data sets, predictions for such stands cannot be relied upon in the same manner as on those for stands which are mirrored in the data sets.
