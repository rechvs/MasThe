\section{Selection of data}

\subsection{Maximum basal area and self-thinning}

In his definition of ``maximum basal area'', \textcite{Assmann1970} points out that maximum basal area is only achieved in stands which have not actively been thinned.  In this context, ``active thinning'' means a reduction of stand density exceeding natural density dependent mortality, also known as ``natural thinning'' \parencite{SAF1958} or ``self-thinning'' \parencite{Roehrig1992}.  While self-thinning, by definition, is a naturally occurring phenomenon, the actual cause of thinning, be it inter-plant competition or human influence, is of no relevance to the study at hand as long as the extent of thinning does not exceed natural rates.  Thus, data selection was based on the following rationale: a stand is considered to have maximum basal area, as long as its thinning rate is roughly equal to the self-thinning rate of a stand of the same species.  This, however, requires knowledge of the self-thinning rates of \beech{} and \spruce{}.

\textcite{Reineke1933} proposed that every forest stand, regardless of tree species and stand development, is subject to the same self-thinning rate given by the equation
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:reineke}
  \log N = -1.605 \log D + k ~.
\end{equation}
According to \refeq{eq:reineke}, every increase in the logarithm of mean diameter leads to a \num{1.605}-fold decrease in the logarithm of stand density.

However, the universal applicability of \refeq{eq:reineke} has been called into question.  As an alternative approach, \textcite{Charru2012} proposed the use of a quadratic, rather than a linear logarithmic diameter term in the right hand side of \refeq{eq:reineke}. A similar approach is taken by \textcite{Schuetz2008,Schuetz2010,Zeide1995}, whose results suggested to add a quadratic logarithmic diameter term to the right hand side of \refeq{eq:reineke}.  \textcite{Meyer1938} found that for \ponderosa{}, the line reported by \textcite{Reineke1933} had to be changed to a slightly concave curve in order to fit observations.  

Despite the apparent shortcomings of \refeq{eq:reineke}, its general form has been upheld by other studies.  Building on the findings of \textcite{Drew1979}, \textcite{VanderSchaaf2010,VanderSchaaf2008} argued that \refeq{eq:reineke} is valid, but only during a specific phase of stand development.  Similarly, \textcite{Zeide1985} suggested that \refeq{eq:reineke} \refeq{eq:reineke} is only applicable during the stage of full canopy closure.  A different approach encountered in the literature is to use a species-specific slope rather than the constant of \num{-1.605} of \refeq{eq:reineke} \parencite{MacKinney1935,Pretzsch2005,Charru2012,Pretzsch2006,Río2001,Sterba1987,Vacchiano2013,Vospernik2015,Zeide1985,Zeide1987,VanderSchaaf2007}.  See \reftab{tab:SpeciesSpecificReinekeSlopes} for an overview of slopes for \beech{} and \spruce{} as reported in the literature.  \textcite{Pretzsch2000,Pretzsch2002} showed that the rule of \textcite{Reineke1933} may be considered a special case of the \num{-3 / 2} power rule of \textcite{Yoda1963}, claiming that as long as the \num{-3 / 2} power rule is valid, species-specific deviations from Reineke’s constant of \num{-1.605} are a result of species-specific diameter-biomass relationships.

Considering the current state of research on the topic of self-thinning rates of \beech{} and \spruce{}, an intermediate approach was taken in the present study.  While the general form of \refeq{eq:reineke} was utilized, species-specific slopes were incorporated in order to test whether a stand was subject to self-thinning and thus could be considered to be at maximum stand density.
