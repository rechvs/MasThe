The models presented in this study are of 3 different types: generalized additive models (GAMs), shape constrained additive models (SCAMs), and generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSSs).  Each model type will be detailed separately in the following sections in the afforementioned order.  Please note that, unless stated otherwise, mathematical symbols used for model explanation do not retain their meaning accross model types.  Subsequently, the settings used for calculating the models will be described.
