The AIC of all \num{6} models for each species is reported in \Cref{tab:AICOverview}.  The lowest AIC for \Beech{} and \Spruce{} was achieved by models GAMLSS1 (\num{380.189}) and GAMLSS3 (\num{705.311}), respectively.

In the following sections, the results of each model will be presented via the following plots:
\begin{itemize}
\item Estimated effect of the stand age variable term over stand age variable.
\item Estimated effect of the \ProductivityIndexVariableText{} predictor term over \ProductivityIndexVariableText{}.
\item Q-Q-plot of model residuals.
\item Model residuals over fitted values.
\item Observed and predicted basal area over stand age.
\item Observed and predicted basal area over top height.
\end{itemize}

Data on which model predictions are based were generated in 2 steps. First, a sequence of age values was generated, ranging from \SIrange{2}{160}{\year}.  Then, a corresponding sequence of top height values was calculated using equation
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:NagelFunctionSolvedForTopHeight}
  \TopHeightMath{}(x) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \ln(x) + \beta_2 \cdot \ln(x)^2 + \ProductivityIndexMath{}_i \cdot (\beta_3 + \beta_4 \cdot \ln(x)),
\end{equation}
where \(\TopHeightMath{}(x)\) is top height in \si{\meter} at age \(x\), \(x\) is stand age, \(\ProductivityIndexMath{}_i\) is the absolute productivity index of stand of yield class \(i\) as reported in \Cref{tab:SchoberProductivityIndices}, and \(\beta_0, \ldots, \beta_4\) are species-specific coefficients as reported in \Cref{tab:NagelFunctionCoefficients} \parencite{Nagel1999}.  Subsequently, corresponding sequences of stand age variable and \ProductivityIndexVariableText{} were calcluated using \Cref{eq:StandAgeVariable,eq:ProductivityIndexVariable}, respectively.  These were then used as input for model predictions.  Using yield class-specific values for \(\ProductivityIndexMath{}_i\) allowed generation of yield class-specific top height sequences, leading to yield class sensitive predictions of basal area.  Unless otherwise noted, the confidence bands of the estimated smooth function effects include non-zero values of the estimate.
% This suggests that both the stand age variable as well as the \ProductivityIndexVariableText{} are related to basal area in both species \parencite{Wood2001}.  %% This remark belongs in the Discussion.
