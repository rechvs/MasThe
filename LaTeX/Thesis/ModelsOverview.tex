      \caption{Overview of the \texttt{R} functions and formulas used for fitting the models presented in this study. The overview includes
        the model ID,
        the name of the \texttt{R} package (and its version number) which provided the model fitting function,
        the name of the \texttt{R} model fitting function,
        and the formula used in the model fitting function call.
        In the case of GAMLSS1, GAMLSS2, and GAMLSS3, the formula applies only to the location parameter of the assumed probability distribution.
        For all other distribution parameters, the formula was \texttt{gha \textasciitilde{} 1}. \\
