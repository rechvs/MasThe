\subsection{Description of data sets}

Data sets were kindly provided by the \NWFVA{}. The data set size for \Beech{} is reported in \RefTab{tab:ObservationsCountPerEdvidBeech}.  The data set comprises 18 sample plots, with a total of 63 observations.  The data set size for \Spruce{} is reported in \RefTab{tab:ObservationsCountPerEdvidSpruce}.  The data set comprises 28 sample plots, with a total of 100 observations.  In both data sets, the number of observations per sample plot ranges from \numrange{2}{8}.  The geographical location of the sample plots from both data sets is reported in \RefFig{fig:LocationsSamplePlots}.  The dots in both plots of the figure do not add up to the total number of sample plots of the respective species because some sample plots were part of the same trial and therefore shared the same geographical location.
Figure \ref{fig:AltitudeSamplePlots} shows the altitude above sea level of sample plots from both data sets.  For \Beech{}, it ranges from \SIrange{40}{565}{\meter}, with a mean of \SI{315.6}{\meter}.  For \Spruce{}, it ranges from \SIrange{20}{750}{\meter}, with a mean of \SI{404}{\meter}.
% As can be seen from \RefFig{fig:AltitudeSamplePlots}, sample plots of both species cover a wide range of altitudes above sea level (\Beech{}: \SIrange{40}{565}{\meter}; \Spruce{}: \SIrange{20}{750}{\meter}).

Figure \ref{fig:TrainingDataYieldClassClassification} depicts the development of top height \(\TopHeight\) over stand age for \Beech{} (top) and \Spruce{} (bottom).  The dot color signifies the yield class of the respective observation.  Classification of observations into yield classes required multiple steps.  First, the absolute site class \(SI\) in \si{\meter} was computed using the equation
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:NagelFunctionSolvedForSI}
  SI = \frac{\TopHeight(x) + 49.872 - 7.3309 \cdot \ln(x) - 0.77338 \cdot \ln(x)^2 }{0.52684 + 0.10542 \cdot \ln(x)} ,
\end{equation}
\parencite{Nagel1999} where \(x\) is stand age and \(\TopHeight(x)\) is top height at age \(x\) in \si{\meter}.  Next, a sequence of \(\TopHeight{}\)-values at age \SI{100}{\years} was generated, ranging from yield class \num{4} to yield class \num{-2}, using an increment of \SI{0.1}{\meter}.  Values for yield classes \numrange{4}{1} were taken from \textcite{Schober1995} for moderately thinned stands of the respective species, while values for yield classes \numrange{0}{-2} were linearly interpolated from those for yield classes \numlist{2; 1}.  This sequence was then restricted to the range between the best yield class needed to include the lowest observed \(SI\)-value and the worst yield class needed to include the highest observed \(SI\)-value.  A color palette matching this restricted sequence was then generated, ranging from red (worst yield class) over yellow and green to blue (best yield class).  Each observed \(SI\)-value was then mapped to the color representing the corresponding \(\TopHeight{}\)-value.  As can be seen from \RefFig{fig:TrainingDataYieldClassClassification}, several differences between the \Beech{} data set and the \Spruce{} data set exist:
in the former, observed stand age spans \SI{118.6}{\years}, ranging from \SIrange{35}{153.6}{\years}, observed \(\TopHeight{}\) spans \SI{22.9}{\meter}, ranging from \SIrange{16.3}{39.2}{\meter}, and observed yield class varies between \numlist{4; -1};
in the latter, observed stand age spans \SI{98}{\years}, ranging from \SIrange{15}{113}{\years}, observed \(\TopHeight{}\) spans \SI{24.2}{\meter}, ranging from \SIrange{9.1}{33.3}{\meter}, and observed yield class varies between \numlist{4; -2}.
