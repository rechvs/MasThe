\subsection{Description of data sets}

The data set size for \Beech{} is reported in \RefTab{tab:ObservationsCountPerEdvidBeech}.  The data set comprises 18 sample plots, with a total of 63 observations and a mean of \num{3.5} observations per sample plot.  The data set size for \Spruce{} is reported in \RefTab{tab:ObservationsCountPerEdvidSpruce}.  The data set comprises 28 sample plots, with a total of 100 observations and a mean of \num{3.6} observations per sample plot.  In both data sets, the number of observations per sample plot ranges from \numrange{2}{8}.

The geographical location and the altitude above sea level of sample plots are reported in \RefFig{fig:LocationsSamplePlots} and \RefFig{fig:SpeciesAltitudeOfSamplePlots}, respectively.  The dots in the plots of both figures do not add up to the total number of sample plots of the respective species because some sample plots were part of the same trial and therefore shared the same geographical location and altitude.  In the \Beech{} data set, altitude above sea level spans \SI{525}{\meter}, ranging from \SIrange{40}{565}{\meter}, with a mean of \SI{313.2}{\meter}.  In the case of \Spruce{} it spans \SI{730}{\meter}, ranging from \SIrange{20}{750}{\meter}, with a mean of \SI{410.5}{\meter}.

In Figures \ref{fig:StandAgeTopHeightYieldClassClassification}, \ref{fig:StandAgeSiteIndexYieldClassClassification}, and \ref{fig:StandAgeBasalAreaYieldClassClassification}, dot color signifies the (fractional) yield class of the respective observation.  Classification of observations into yield classes required multiple steps, which were undertaken separately for each species.  First, for all observations the absolute site index \(SI\) in \si{\meter} was computed using the equation
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:NagelFunctionSolvedForSI}
  SI = \frac{\TopHeight(x) + 49.872 - 7.3309 \cdot \ln(x) - 0.77338 \cdot \ln(x)^2 }{0.52684 + 0.10542 \cdot \ln(x)} ,
\end{equation}
\parencite{Nagel1999} where \(x\) is stand age and \(\TopHeight(x)\) is top height in \si{\meter} at age \(x\).  Next, a sequence of \(\TopHeight{}\)-values at age \SI{100}{\year} was generated, ranging from yield class \num{4} to yield class \num{-2}, using an increment of \SI{0.1}{\meter}, thus also covering fractional yield classes.  Values for yield classes \numrange{4}{1} were taken from \textcite{Schober1995} for moderately thinned stands of the respective species, while values for yield classes \numrange{0}{-2} were linearly interpolated from those for yield classes \numlist{2; 1}.   This sequence was then restricted to the range between the best yield class needed to include the lowest observed \(SI\) and the worst yield class needed to include the highest observed \(SI\).  A color palette matching this restricted sequence was then generated, ranging from red (worst yield class observed) over yellow and green to blue (best yield class observed).  Each observed \(SI\) was then mapped to the color representing the corresponding \(\TopHeight{}\)-value.  Considering \RefFig{fig:StandAgeTopHeightYieldClassClassification}, the method of yield class classification yielded plausible results in both data sets:  for a given top height, yield class gradually worsens as stand age increases.

As can be seen from \RefFig{fig:StandAgeTopHeightYieldClassClassification}, several differences between the \Beech{} data set and the \Spruce{} data set exist.  In the former, stands are notably older and cover a wider range of ages, with stand age ranging from \SIrange{35}{153.6}{\year} (difference: \SI{118.6}{\year}), whereas in the latter it ranges from \SIrange{15}{113}{\year} (difference: \SI{98}{\year}).  Consequently, stands in the \Beech{} data set have a higher top height, with \(\TopHeight\) ranging from \SIrange{16.3}{39.2}{\meter} (difference: \SI{22.9}{\meter}), but \Spruce{} stands cover a slightly wider range of top heights, with \(\TopHeight{}\) ranging from \SIrange{9.1}{33.3}{\meter} (difference: \SI{24.2}{\meter}).   In the case of \Beech{}, the maximal top height of all observations was reached by a sample plot of intermediate yield class (\(\approx{} 1\)) compared to the other sample plots in the data set.   In the case of \Spruce{}, the maximal top height of all observations was reached by a sample plot of bad yield class (\(\approx{} 2\)) compared to the other sample plots in the data set.

\RefFig{fig:StandAgeSiteIndexYieldClassClassification} shows the observed development of site index \(SI\) over stand age for \Beech{} (top) and \Spruce{} (bottom).  For all sample plots in both data sets, the site index changed at least once during stand development.  However, for several sample plots the direction of this change itself differs during stand development and there does not seem to be a general direction to which site index changes adhered.  The \Beech{} data set covers a narrower range of site indices and consequently yield classes than the \Spruce{} one, with \(SI\) ranging from \SIrange{23.7}{38.3}{\meter} (difference: \SI{14.6}{\meter}) and yield class ranging from \numrange{4}{-1} in the former, whereas for \Spruce{} \(SI\) ranges from \SIrange{24.1}{45.2}{\meter} (difference: \SI{21.1}{\meter}) and yield class from \numrange{4}{-2}.

\RefFig{fig:StandAgeBasalAreaYieldClassClassification} depicts the observed development of basal area \(G\) over stand age for \Beech{} (top) and \Spruce{} (bottom).
The \Beech{} data set has a higher minimal and a lower maximal basal area and covers a narrower range of basal areas compared to the \Spruce{} one, with \(G\) ranging from \SIrange{12.6}{51.3}{\square\meter} (difference: \SI{38.7}{\square\meter}) in the former, and from \SIrange{10.8}{79.8}{\square\meter} (difference: \SI{69}{\square\meter}) in the latter.
