\subsection{GAM2}

\Cref{fig:GAM2EffectStandAgeVariable} shows the estimated effect of the stand age variable smooth function over the stand age variable for both species in model GAM2.  General characteristics of the curves are similar to those in \Cref{fig:GAM1EffectStandAgeVariable}:  for \Beech{}, the curve is markedly concave, reaching its maximum at a approximately \(\StandAgeVariableMath{} = \SI{29}{\meter}\), which corresponds to an age of circa \SI{85}{\year};  for \Spruce{}, the curve exhibits a steep increase up to roughly \(\StandAgeVariableMath{} = \SI{15}{\meter}\), which is equivalent to an age of about \SI{30}{\year}, after which the curveâ€™s slope is reduced but remains positive.  As in \Cref{fig:GAM1EffectStandAgeVariable}, in \Beech{} the estimated effect covers a narrower range of values than in \Spruce{} and does not show signs of asymptotic behavior in either species.  The \edf{} of the smooth functions were \num{3.7} and \num{5.32} for \Beech{} and \Spruce{}, respectively.

\Cref{fig:GAM2EffectProductivityIndexVariable} depicts the estimated partial effect of the \ProductivityIndexVariableText{} over the \ProductivityIndexVariableText{} for both species in model GAM2.  The effect is monotone increasing in both species.  However, the slope of \Beech{} line is steeper than that of \Spruce{}.

\Cref{fig:GAM2QQPlot} shows the quantile-quantile plot for model GAM2 for both species.  In \Beech{}, several residuals lie outside the \SI{90}{\percent} reference band, scattered across the whole range of theoretical quantiles.  In \Spruce{}, a few  low quantile residuals lie outside the reference band.

\Cref{fig:GAM2FittedValuesResiduals} shows response residuals over fitted values of model GAM2 for both species.   In \Beech{}, residual variance appears to be constant over the range of fitted values depicted, whereas in \Spruce{}, residual variance appears to be higher for fitted values around \num{50} and lower for other values.

\Cref{fig:GAM2StandAgeBasalAreaObservationsPredictionsYieldClassClassification} depicts basal area over stand age, both observed values as well as predictions of model GAM2.  General model behavior is different between species:  in \Beech{}, prediction curves are concave, reaching their maximum around a stand age of \SI{80}{\year};  in \Spruce{}, prediction curves are increasing throughout the depicted range of stand ages, with a steep increase from \SIrange{0}{30}{\year} and a slower increase thereafter.  In both species, curves are clearly stratified depending on yield class, with curve order following yield class order at all times, i.e., a yield class shows higher basal area predictions than the next best yield class.

\Cref{fig:GAM2TopHeightBasalAreaObservationsPredictionsYieldClassClassification} shows basal area over top height, both observed values as well as predictions of model GAM2.  As in \Cref{fig:GAM2StandAgeBasalAreaObservationsPredictionsYieldClassClassification}, the \Beech{} plot exhibits clear stratification of prediction curves depending on yield class.  For ages up to \SI{20}{\year}, curve order is the inverse of yield class order. Between \SIrange{20}{33}{\year}, curve order switches, so that for ages above \SI{30}{\year}, curve order is the same as yield class order.  In \Spruce{}, curve stratification is visible as well, but curve order is highly erratic, with yield class -2 performing worst and yield class 4 performing best for almost the entire range of stand age depicted.
