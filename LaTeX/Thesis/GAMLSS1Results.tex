\subsection{GAMLSS1}

\Cref{fig:GAMLSS1EffectStandAgeVariable} depicts the estimated effect of the stand age variable smooth function over the stand age variable in model GAMLSS1.  The smooth function used unconstrained P-splines as its basis.  For \Beech{}, the effect is concave, reaching its maximum at a stand age variable value of circa \SI{30}{\meter}, which corresponds to an age of about \SI{90}{\year}.  In \Spruce{}, the effect increases steeply between stand age variable values of \SIrange{5}{15}{\meter} (corresponding to an stand age range of \SIrange{18}{30}{\year}), after which the curve’s slope decreases while remaining positive.  At circa \SI{33}{\meter} (which corresponds to an age of about \SI{86}{\year}) the slope again increases.

\Cref{fig:GAMLSS1EffectProductivityIndexVariable} shows the estimated effect of the \ProductivityIndexVariableText{} smooth function over the \ProductivityIndexVariableText{} in model GAMLSS1.  The smooth function used unconstrained P-splines as its basis.  In \Beech{}, the curve is rather irregularly formed:  for \ProductivityIndexVariableText{} values between \SIrange{-6}{-3.5}{\meter}, the curve has a steep positive slope;  afterwards, the slope decreases, eventually becoming negative, leading to a local minimum of the curve at a \ProductivityIndexVariableText{} value of roughly \SI{2.5}{\meter}; after this, the slope increases again.  For \Spruce{}, the effect’s curve has an almost convex shape, with the lowest and highest effect occurring at the left and right edge of the plot, i.e., at a \ProductivityIndexVariableText{} value of circa \SIlist{-11;10}{\meter}, respectively.

\Cref{fig:GAMLSS1QQPlot} shows the quantile-quantile plots for model GAMLSS1.  In both species, several residuals deviate form the reference line.  However, only one to two of these deviations extend outside the \SI{90}{\percent} reference band in either species.

\Cref{fig:GAMLSS1FittedValuesResiduals} depicts the normalized quantile residuals over fitted values of model GAMLSS1.  In \Beech{}, residual variance appears to increase with fitted values, whereas in \Spruce{}, residual variance appears to be constant over the range of fitted values shown.

\Cref{fig:GAMLSS1StandAgeBasalAreaObservationsPredictionsYieldClassClassification} shows basal area over stand age, both observed values as well as predictions of model GAMLSS1.  In \Beech{}, prediction curves of all yield classes are concave, reaching their maximum at a stand age of about \SI{90}{\year}.  Prediction curves are also stratified, depending on yield class.  However, curve order does not follow yield class order completeley, since the curve of yield class \num{1} lies above that of yield class \num{0}.  Additionally, distance between yield classes is irregular, with yield class \num{3} performing severely worse than yield class \num{2} and yield classes \num{1} and \num{0} performing almost the same.  In \Spruce{}, shape of prediction curves largely resembles the shape of the estimated effect of the stand age variable smooth function shown in \Cref{fig:GAMLSS1EffectStandAgeVariable}:  a steep slope for stand ages up to \SI{30}{\year} and a less steep but still positive slope for stand ages above \SI{30}{\year}.  Curves also exhibit stratification based on yield class.  However, distance between low performing yield classes is rather irregular compared to high performing ones, with yield classes \numlist{3;2} performing almost the same and yield class \num{4} performing only slightly worse than the former two.

\Cref{fig:GAMLSS1TopHeightBasalAreaObservationsPredictionsYieldClassClassification} shows basal area over top height, both observed values as well as predictions of model GAMLSS1.  For \Beech{}, yield class \num{3} performs worst throughout.  For top heights up to \SI{28}{\meter}, yield class \num{1} performs best, after which yield class \num{-2} becomes the best performing yield class.  For top heights above \SI{32.5}{\meter}, curve order follows yield class order, whereas for lower top heights, curver order is rather erratic.  In \Spruce{}, curve order for top heights up to \SI{22}{\meter} is the inverse of yield class order, with yield class \num{4} performing best and yield class \num{-2} performing worst.  For top heights above \SI{22}{\meter}, curve order is highly erratic, with yield class \num{-2} never performing best.
