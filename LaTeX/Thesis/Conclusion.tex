The presented data selection mechanism proved a valid way of removing non-maximum basal area observations from large data sets.
It could be shown that GAMs, SCAMs, and GAMLSSs provide useful tools for modeling maximum basal area of pure even-aged \Beech{} and \Spruce{} stands from northwest Germany.
The presented models use stand productivity and stand age as predictor variables.
This allows for more realistic predictions than previous modeling approaches.
Restriction of model flexibility led to improved plausibility of model predictions, but reduced statistical power of the models.  
Further model refinement would greatly benefit from increased data set sizes.
