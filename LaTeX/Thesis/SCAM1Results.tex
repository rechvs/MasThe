\subsection{SCAM1}

\Cref{fig:SCAM1EffectStandAgeVariable} shows the estimated effect of the stand age variable smooth function over the stand age variable in model SCAM1.  The smooth function uses P-splines constrained to be increasing and concave as its basis.  In the case of \Beech{}, the smooth function behaves asymptotic:  for stand age variable values up to circa \SI{25}{\meter} (which corresponds to an age of about \SI{67}{\year}), the smooth function value increases before levelling off.  The \edf{} of the smooth function is \num{1.86}.  In the case of \Spruce{}, the overall curve shape is similar to the corresponding figure of model GAM2 (cp. \Cref{fig:GAM2EffectStandAgeVariable}):  the smooth function value increases steeply for stand age variable values up to \SI{12.5}{\meter} (which corresponds to an age of about \SI{25}{\year}), after which the increase continues, but at a lower rate.  The \edf{} of the smooth function is \num{3.01}.

\Cref{fig:SCAM1EffectProductivityIndexVariable} depicts the estimated linear effect of the \ProductivityIndexVariableText{} over the \ProductivityIndexVariableText{} in model SCAM1.  As in model GAM2, the effect is monotone increasing in both species, having its root at approximately \SI{0}{\meter}.

\Cref{fig:SCAM1QQPlot} shows the quantile-quantile plots for model SCAM1.  In \Beech{}, several residuals of low, intermediate, and high quantiles lie outside the \SI{90}{\percent} reference band.  In \Spruce{}, multiple residuals of low and intermediate quantiles lie outside the reference band.

\Cref{fig:SCAM1FittedValuesResiduals} shows response residuals over fitted values of model SCAM1.  In \Beech{}, residual variance appears to be constant over the range of fitted values depicted, whereas in \Spruce{}, residual variance appears to be higher for fitted values around \num{50} and lower for other values.

\Cref{fig:SCAM1StandAgeBasalAreaObservationsPredictionsYieldClassClassification} depicts basal area over stand age, both observed values as well as predictions of model SCAM1.  In both species, the overall shape of prediction curves follows closely that of the stand age variable smooth function as shown in \Cref{fig:SCAM1EffectStandAgeVariable}:  in \Beech{}, predicted basal area increases up to an age of about \SI{67}{\year} at which it levels off;  in \Spruce{}, predicted basal area increases steeply up to an age of about \SI{25}{\year}, after which the increase continues, albeit at a lower rate.  In both species, curves for different yield classes are clearly separated from each other, with curve order being the inverse of yield class order in both species.

\Cref{fig:SCAM1TopHeightBasalAreaObservationsPredictionsYieldClassClassification} shows basal area over top height, both observed values as well as predictions of model SCAM1.  In \Beech{}, stratification of prediction curves is rather weakly pronounced up to a top height of about \SI{17}{\meter}, with curve order being the inverse of yield class order, i.e., worse yield classes outperforming better yield classes.  Between top heights of \SIrange{17}{31}{\meter}, curve order switches due to basal area of worse yield classes levelling off at lower top heights than that of better yield classes, so that for top heights above \SI{31}{\meter} curve order follows yield class order.  In \Spruce{}, a similar pattern is visible:  for top heights up to \SI{9}{\meter}, curve order is the inverse of yield class order;  between a top height of \SIrange{9}{26}{\meter}, curve order switches due to curve slopes of worse yield classes decreasing at lower top heights than that of better yield classes, so that for top heights above \SI{26}{\meter} curve order follows yield class order.
