\subsection{GAM1}

\Cref{fig:GAM1EffectStandAgeVariable} depicts the estimated effect of the stand age variable smooth function over the stand age variable in model GAM1.  The smooth function uses unconstrained thin plate regression splines as its basis.
For \Beech{}, the estimated effect reaches its absolute maximum at roughly \(\StandAgeVariableMath{} = \SI{27.5}{\meter}\), which corresponds to an age of about \SI{76}{\year}.  After that, the effect starts to decrease.  In the case of \Spruce{}, the effect increases throughout all of the interval depicted, leading to the highest estimate at the end of the interval (\(\StandAgeVariableMath{} = \SI{40}{\meter}\)), which corresponds to an age of about \SI{125}{\year}.  Compared to \Spruce{}, the estimated effect of the stand age variable covers a narrower range in the \Beech{} model.  This is in accordance with differences in the range of the stand age variable between species.  The estimated effect does not show signs of asymptotic behavior in either species.  The \edf{} of the smooth function are \num{2.66} and \num{6.39} for \Beech{} and \Spruce{}, respectively.

\Cref{fig:GAM1EffectProductivityIndexVariable} depicts the estimated effect of the \ProductivityIndexVariableText{} smooth function over the \ProductivityIndexVariableText{} in model GAM1.  The smooth function also uses unconstrained thin plate regression splines as its basis.  In the case of \Beech{}, the estimated effect shows a sharp increase for \(\SI{-12.5}{\meter} \leq \ProductivityIndexVariableMath{} \leq \SI{-2.5}{\meter}\), starting at an estimate of approximately \num{3} before almost completely levelling off at an estimate of zero.  In the case of \Spruce{}, the estimate starts at around zero and never strays very far from it in the interval depicted.  The \edf{} of the smooth function are \num{4.87} and \num{6.48} for \Beech{} and \Spruce{}, respectively.

\Cref{fig:GAM1QQPlot} shows the quantile-quantile plots for model GAM1.  In both species, response residuals follow the reference line fairly closely with some residuals lying outside the \SI{90}{\percent} reference band.

\Cref{fig:GAM1FittedValuesResiduals} shows response residuals over fitted values of model GAM1.  In both species, variability of residuals appears to increase with fitted value.

\Cref{fig:GAM1StandAgeBasalAreaObservationsPredictionsYieldClassClassification} shows basal area over stand age, both observed values as well as predictions of model GAM1.  General behavior of the model is notably different for each species:  in the case of \Beech{}, predicted basal area starts to decrease between stand ages of \SIrange{70}{90}{\year}, while in \Spruce{} it increases throughout the whole depicted stand age interval, especially between \SIrange{80}{100}{\year}.  In both species, predicted basal area shows stratification depending on yield class.  However, the order of curves does not coincide with yield class order:  in the case of \Beech{}, yield class 1 lies above yield class 0, while in the case of \Spruce{}, yield class 1 lies above yield class -2 and yield class 3 lies above yield class 2.  In \Beech{}, yield class 3 performs much worse than yield class 2.  Other yield classes of \Beech{} and all yield classes of \Spruce{} do not exhibit as large distances between adjacent yield classes. 

\Cref{fig:GAM1TopHeightBasalAreaObservationsPredictionsYieldClassClassification} shows basal area over top height, both observed values as well as predictions of model GAM1.  General model behavior is the same as in \Cref{fig:GAM1StandAgeBasalAreaObservationsPredictionsYieldClassClassification}.  Stratification of curves depending on yield class is visible.  In the case of \Beech{}, the order of curves (excluding yield class 3) changes during the depicted age interval.  For top heights up to \SI{22}{\meter}, order of curves is almost the inverse of yield class order, with yield class 2 showing best performance and yield class -2 showing worst performance.  Between top heights of \SIrange{22}{35}{\meter}, order of curves shifts until eventually stratification follows yield class order.  In contrast, \Spruce{} shows a highly erratic pattern of stratification, the only constant of which is that yield class -2 performs worst of all yield classes throughout.
